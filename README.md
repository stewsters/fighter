# Starfighter

## TODO
// round asteroids
// sound - more immersion
// teams - missiles should lock onto opposition
// move camera up
// split screen - people like competition
// forward 25%
// time to live on missiles and projectiles / expirations
// collisions - bullets need to kill stuff, ships need to collide into asteroids
// Better spawn locations

## Visual

tracking system - show where enemies are around you
explosions
